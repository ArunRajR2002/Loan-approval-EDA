## Loan Approval Risk Analysis

### Overview
In today’s financial ecosystem, determining loan approval is a critical process that requires evaluating the risk associated with lending money. Financial institutions are tasked with assessing various factors to ensure that loans are granted to applicants with the capability to repay, minimizing the risk of default. This project aims to analyze the financial risk factors that influence loan approval decisions using a dataset that includes key features such as applicants' age, income, credit score, employment status, loan amount, and payment history.

### Objectives
- Identify patterns and relationships between financial factors and loan approval outcomes.
- Understand how financial stability, past credit behavior, and demographic information contribute to risk assessment.
- Analyze metrics such as debt-to-income ratio, previous loan defaults, and monthly loan payments.
- Provide insights to improve loan approval strategies and reduce financial risk.

### Key Research Questions
1. What is the distribution of loan approvals across different loan purposes?
2. How do education and employment status impact risk scores?
3. What is the correlation between credit history and loan approval outcomes?
4. How do financial metrics, such as debt-to-income ratio, affect loan approval rates?

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of **210,000 samples** and includes the following key features:

#### Applicant Information
- Age
- Education Level
- Employment Status
- Marital Status
- Number of Dependents

#### Financial Data
- Annual Income
- Monthly Debt Payments
- Loan Amount
- Loan Duration
- Home Ownership Status

#### Credit History
- Credit Score
- Number of Open Credit Lines
- Credit Card Utilization Rate
- Number of Credit Inquiries

#### Risk Factors
- Debt-to-Income Ratio
- Bankruptcy History
- Previous Loan Defaults
- Payment History
- Utility Bills Payment History

#### Loan Outcome
- Loan Approved
- Risk Score

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize financial data, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize distributions, identify trends, and detect outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve predictive power.
4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Risk Assessment Framework**: Develop insights to help lenders refine decision-making processes.

### Expected Outcomes
- A deeper understanding of financial risk factors affecting loan approvals.
- Data-driven strategies to minimize loan defaults.
- A predictive model to assess loan approval probability based on applicant data.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` (if deep learning models are applied)
- **Visualization Tools**: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`

### Conclusion
Through this analysis, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of the financial risk landscape, helping financial institutions refine their loan approval processes and mitigate risks associated with lending.
